## 1. Introduction
In our daily life, we only have twenty-four hours. As a result, it could be challenging to manage all our tasks in a single day. This imposes constraints on our day-to-day job. Time management is essential for balancing work, social life, and sleep. Time division is required to assist the individual in completing all of their responsibilities. Thus, a timetable should be created for the individual's duties. Students usually must complete a variety of assignments and it is often difficult for them to keep track of their tasks. Their ability to manage their time has become critical. As a result, effective time management is essential.

ToDoList is a simple web application that allows users, mainly students of all levels, to manage their homework in a checklist format. Users may also create a list of chores to perform or other items connected to schoolwork. Typically, these tasks are grouped in order of priority, and our system assists the user in doing so. Users can utilize the ToDoList application to replace the conventional approach of writing down homework lists on paper and conveniently access them on the same desktop screen where they attend online classes.

Students no longer need to rely on their memory to recall the duties that they have in their everyday life because everything can be done through their desktop or mobile phone. They can use ToDoList to set reminders for crucial assignments and other activities assigned by professors, such as attending extracurricular classes or online meetings. The Task section assists users in prioritising the tasks on the list, allowing them to arrange their routine to finish the chores that require their urgent attention first, followed by the things that have the least priority. Users can be certain that they will keep on top of their work with these capabilities offered on the web application, and they will no longer have to worry about forgetting their daily responsibilities.

In conclusion, students who use ToDoList no longer have to struggle with time management. We believe that this application will alleviate the difficulties that many students might experience during online classes.
